Invert a binary tree.

Example:

Input:

     4
   /   \
  2     7
 / \   / \
1   3 6   9
Output:

     4
   /   \
  7     2
 / \   / \
9   6 3   1
Trivia:
This problem was inspired by this original tweet by Max Howell:

Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you canâ€™t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so f*** off.

        return root  ## at the end return root
